# 🧠 CypherMind: AI Threat Hunter

## 🚀 Overview
**CypherMind** is an intelligent cybersecurity framework developed in Python. It's designed to assist security analysts and network administrators in proactively identifying potential threats, detecting anomalies in network traffic, and automating the initial stages of incident response.

This project is a deep dive into combining **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** with **Network Security** to create smarter, more efficient threat detection mechanisms.

## ✨ Features (Planned/Under Development)
- **AI-Driven Anomaly Detection:** Utilizes machine learning models to identify unusual patterns in network logs.
- **Threat Intelligence Feed Integration:** Connects to public threat intelligence sources (e.g., AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal) to enrich data.
- **Automated IP/Domain Reputation Check:** Instantly assesses the risk score of suspicious IPs or URLs.
- **Vulnerability Scanner Integration:** (Future) Simple port scanning and service enumeration for initial reconnaissance.
- **Interactive CLI:** A user-friendly command-line interface for easy interaction.

## 🛠️ Installation
To get started with CypherMind, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/CypherMind](https://github.com/YourUsername/CypherMind)
    cd CypherMind
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: `requirements.txt` will be created as the project develops, including libraries like `scikit-learn`, `requests`, `python-whois`)*

## 💡 How It Works (Conceptual)
CypherMind works by continuously monitoring specified network logs or receiving input about suspicious entities. It then processes this information through its AI engine to flag high-risk activities or provide detailed intelligence reports on known bad actors.
